                   <p>
                    I am Austen Haymond and I am a Full Stack Developer. I am passionate about many things, but when it comes to programming it comes natural to me. My dad has instilled a love for it in me since I was little. I completed the University of Arizona’s Coding Boot Camp with a certificate in May 2020. I hope to soon pursue a Bachelor’s in Software Engineering to continue my education.

                    Before becoming a developer, I served a two-year religious mission in Monterrey, Mexico for my church. While serving my mission, I was able to learn Spanish and a love for Mexican food. Since then, I have worked as a legal assistant for varios law firms.

                    I enjoy playing soccer with friends and attending Phoenix Rising games. I also occasionally like binge- watch Netflix with my beautiful wife. I strongly believe in the importance of family, as they are my biggest supporters.
